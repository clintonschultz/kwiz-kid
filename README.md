## Architecture 🏗️

### State Management
KwizKid uses a unidirectional state flow pattern where:
- **State** can only be mutated in one place (the reducer)
- **Actions** are dispatched to trigger state changes
- **Middleware** handles side effects like API calls and analytics

### Core Components
- `AppStore`: Central state management
- `AppReducer`: Pure functions that handle state transitions
- `AppActions`: All possible actions in the app
- `Middleware`: Handles side effects and external services

### Services
- `iCloudAuthService`: iCloud authentication and user data sync
- `RevenueCatService`: Subscription management
- `ChildSafetyService`: Content filtering and safety features
- `QuizContentService`: AI-generated question creation
